Files:
allIngredients.txt: text file containing a list of ingredients to pull from when geneating many fake recipes

bananaBread.txt: text file containing the list of ingredients used to make banana bread

baseline.py: code to create our baseline

binaryClassification.py: code to run our binary classifier, trains on a set of 100 recipes, fake and real, and tests each number of ingredients using 30 fake recipes, plus another run using a random number of ingredients in each of the 30 recipes

classiferUtil.py: helper functions for binary classification

cooking_verbs.txt, cooking_verbs_all.txt, cooking_verbs_arbitrary.txt: different lists of verbs to use as variables in the CSP

createNewJson.py: used to turn the csv data into a json

enchilada.txt: ingredients to make an enchilada

epi_r.csv: dataset in csv form

full_format_recipes.json: dataset in json form

generatedData.txt: data generated by our initial evaluation function

ravioli.txt: ingredients list to make ravioli

readData.py: code to read the data from the dataset and to generate fake recipes using the CSP

recipeUtil.py: helper functions for our CSP

stripRealRecipes.py: code that strips formatting from dataset so real and fake recipes have a similar format

testIngredients*.txt: lists of ingredients used to test the output of the csp

trainOnRecipes.py: runs fake recipe generation and creates the CSP and translates the output

Commands:

To generate a fake recipe based on ingredients of your choosing using the CSV model, run:
python readData.py epi_r.csv full_format_recipes.json <ingredientslist>.txt
 
To generate a fake recipe using the baseline model, run:
python readData.py epi_r.csv full_format_recipes.json <ingredientslist>.txt -b

To run the binary classifier:
python binaryClassification.py
